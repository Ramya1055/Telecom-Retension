# Telecom-Retension


The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that predicts customer churn for a telecom company. By analyzing customer data—such as monthly charges, contract type, internet usage patterns, and tenure with the company—the model identifies customers who are at high risk of leaving. This enables the company to proactively engage with these customers through targeted retention strategies like personalized offers or enhanced support, ultimately reducing churn rates and minimizing revenue loss.


Project Description

In this project, I developed a machine learning model to predict customer churn for a telecom company, with the goal of identifying customers at risk of leaving the service. The process began with collecting and analyzing customer data, including demographics, contract type, subscribed services, monthly charges, tenure, and payment methods. I performed data cleaning, handled missing values, and transformed categorical variables into numerical format.Using correlation analysis and visualizations, I explored key patterns in the data. The dataset was then split into training and testing sets, and a Logistic Regression model was trained to predict churn. Model performance was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score.The results revealed critical factors driving churn—particularly contract type, tenure, and monthly charges. These insights provided actionable recommendations to help the company implement targeted retention strategies and reduce customer attrition.
